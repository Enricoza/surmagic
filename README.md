## Wiki

Surmagic's [Wiki page](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic/wiki) is kind of under conctruction. anyway you can take a look if you didn't find what you're looking for or maybe even want to improve the Wiki.

## About

After Xcode 11 now Xcode fully supports using and creating binary frameworks in Swift. Simultaneously support devices and Simulator with the new XCFramework bundle type. XCFrameworks support binary distribution of Swift and C-based code. A single XCFramework can contain a variant for the simulator, and for the device. This means you can ship slices for any of the architectures, including simulator, any Apple OS and even separate slices for UIKit and AppKit apps.

### Requirements

- Xcode 11 and above
- Swift 5.1 and above

## Installing surmagic

### Xcode command line tools (macOS)

Install the command line tools with command below:

```
xcode-select --install
```

### Homebrew (macOS)

[Brew](https://brew.sh) is the Recommended way to install/uninstall the surmagic.

```
brew tap gurhub/surmagic
brew install surmagic
```

This command will install surmagic to your desired bash.

## Setting up surmagic

Open desired terminal application and enter inside of your project directory's root: 

```
cd [path-on-your-disk]/your-project
```

Use command below to create necessary _surmagic_ directory and files.

``` 
surmagic init
``` 

This will create surmagic directory and a Surfile like below:

- --- your-project
- ------ surmagic
- --------- Surfile

## How to Use

After setting up your directory, and filling mandatory parameters in the [Surfile](#what-is-the-surfile) you can simply use:

```
surmagic xcf
```
command to create an XCFramework. Thats it.

### All Aviable Commands and Options

```
USAGE: surmagic <subcommand>

OPTIONS:
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.

SUBCOMMANDS:
  init                    Creates the mandatory directory (surmagic) and files.
  xcf (default)           Creates an XCFramework via Surfile.
  See 'surmagic help <subcommand>' for detailed help.
```

## Passing parameters to _surmagic_ command-line tools

Surmagic contains several command-line tools, e.g. **surmagic xcf** or **surmagic init**. To pass parameters to these tools, append the option names and values as you would for a normal shell command:

```
surmagic [tool] --[option] --[option] ...‚àû

surmagic init
surmagic xcf --verbose
```

## What is the Surfile

It's a standart Plist (XML) file.

```
<dict>
  <key>output_path</key>
  <string>_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_NAME_HERE_</string>
  <key>framework</key>
  <string>_FRAMEWORK_NAME_HERE_</string>
  <key>targets</key>
  <array>
    <dict>
      <key>sdk</key>
      <string>_TARGET_OS_HERE_</string>
      <key>workspace</key>
      <string>_WORKSPACE_NAME_HERE_.xcworkspace</string>
      <key>scheme</key>
      <string>_SCHEME_NAME_HERE_</string>
    </dict>
  </array>
</dict>
```

##### SDK Options 

| Key            	| Description     	|
|----------------	|-----------------	|

| iOSSimulator   	| iOS Simulator   	|
| macOS          	| macOS           	|
| macOSCatalyst  	| macOS Catalyst  	|
| tvOS           	| tvOS            	|

| watchOS        	| watchOS         	|
| watchSimulator 	| watch Simulator 	|


## Further Reading

### Advantages in comparison with the FAT Framework Approach:

* Packing dependencies under all target platforms and architectures into one single bundle from the box

* Connection of the bundle in the format of XCFramework, as a single dependency for all target platforms and architectures

* Missing the need of building fat/universal framework

* No need to get rid of x86_64 slices before uploading end applications to AppStore

### Why not the Swift Package Manager (SPM)?

Well, why not!ü§ì It's the easiest! But, Swift PM only allows you to perform the delivery of libs in the form of *open source* code with the description of dependencies.

Apple presented XCFramework as **a new binary format of packing the libs**, considering it as an alternative for [Swift Packages](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

## Uninstalling surmagic

Use the command below to uninstall surmagic from your bash:

```
brew uninstall surmagic
```
