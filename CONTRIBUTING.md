# Contributing to _surmagic_

## If you see a way to improve the project or want to report a problem or ask a question

Before submitting a new GitHub issue, please make sure to:

- Check out the [README](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic) page on this repo
- Check out [surmagic wiki](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic/wiki)
- Search for existing GitHub issues
- If you'd like to **ask a general question**, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/surmagic).
- If you **have a feature request**, open an [issue](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic/issues).
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic/pulls). It's better to begin with an [issue](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic/issues) rather than a [pull request](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic/pulls), though, because we might disagree whether the proposed change is an actual improvement. :wink:
- If you **found a bug**, _and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it_, or the above doesn't help, please submit [an issue](https://github.com/gurhub/surmagic/issues) on GitHub and provide information about your setup via the Bug Report Issue Template.

Thanks! :v:
